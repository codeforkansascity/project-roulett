# project-roulette

## Problem Statement

What are other Brigades doing that can benefit Kansas City?  Let's spin the roulette wheel and find out.
This project space is for the analysis and visualization of other national project efforts to bring
greater visibility on both types of solutions and types of functionality that can be applied
locally.

## Technology Patterns
This a text only repo, but we intend to add other tools later.

Here are some ways *you* can contribute:

* by adding locations, see below
* by reviewing other Brigade projects and commenting on them
* by analyzing the data for us
